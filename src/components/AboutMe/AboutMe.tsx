    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about building complex, high-performance systems with multiple moving parts. 
      My fascination with breaking ideas down to their fundamental first principles has driven 
      me to explore the synergy between independent components working together as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience spans full-stack development, blockchain engineering, and big data processing. 
      I've worked extensively in programmatic advertising, fintech, and blockchain, designing and 
      optimizing high-performance data architectures. Recently, my focus has shifted toward 
      recommendation systems, personalization models, and low-latency communicationâ€”technologies 
      that power intelligent, adaptive experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond software, my curiosity extends to human anatomy, cognition, emotions, and social interactions. Whether it's optimizing distributed networks or understanding 
      the complexities of human behavior, I'm fascinated by how systems evolve and function at scale. I am driven to understand these large scale system interaction down to their fundamental first principles.
