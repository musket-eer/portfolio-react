    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about complex, high-performance systems with multiple moving parts. 
      My fascination with breaking ideas down to their fundamental first principles has driven 
      me to explore the synergy between independent components working together as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience spans full-stack development, blockchain engineering, and big data processing. 
      I've worked extensively in programmatic advertising, fintech, and blockchain, designing and 
      optimizing high-performance data architectures. Recently, I have also developed an interest towards 
      recommendation systems, personalization models, and low-latency communication.
    </p>
    <p>
    I like complexity. Not just in computer systems, but in all manifestations around us. In society, emotions, history and geography around us.  </p>
